Major Incidents

Tix now provides a Major Incident management capability. This is still in it's infancy and is there to promote discussion and development. Currently working as part of the Major Incident functionality is the following:

    1.  Access to Major Incidents is through the config screen.

    2.  AInitial screen shows existing Major incidents or the ability to add a major incident.

    3.  A Major Incident can be added with an associated type and boundary. Select Menus exist to select MI Management Hierarchy from users registered on the syste. This currently uses the UK/European Gold / Silver / Bronze structure.
	
	4.  Fields exist to add description and notes throughout the lifetime of the MI
	
	5.  Lists exist to add existing incidents to be managed as part of the MI
	
	6.  For the future, reporting will be added and the ability to add a new Incident direct from the MI screen and automatically associate with the MI.
