OS-Watch

Tix now provides timed notifications of responders in two classes:  those on-scene, and those with status values or on incident types identifying these as to be 'watched'. Notifications consist of popup windows listing such responders, with links to appropriate functions.

These notifications are presented to each super-admin logged in.  

    1.  Config/Setting "OS-watch" consists of a slash-separated set of three numbers representing the minutes between successive notifications, grouped by priority.

    2.  Example:  A value of '5/15/60' will report every 5 minutes responders on-scene at priority incidents; every 15 minutes for normal priority calls, and 60 minutes for other responders to be monitored on an hourly basis (Let's refer to these as Routine). A zero value turns off that time slice, so '0/0/120' reports only units with status value or incident type with 'watch' set every two hours, while '0/0/0' deactivates it completely.

    4.  Routine includes responers with Unit Status with 'Watch' checked, and also responders on calls that have 'Watch' checked in the Incident Type, if these aren't on-scene.

    3.  With '5/15/60', the 5-minute window popup will list only those on-scene at priority calls; the 15-minute list will show responders on-scene at normal and priority calls; the 60-minute list will list all - Priority, Normal and Routine.
